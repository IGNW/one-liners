# one-liners

## what

A common repo library to store tried-and-true code glue in any language. If you don't see your language, feel free to add whatever you need.

## why

As a developer, I need a place to store field-tested code, quick hacks, and short, general purpose scripts. A common repo allows me and my colleagues a place to share such code

## how

Pull the repo, branch, add your script and push.

Preferred format: one text file per one-liner, with explanatory comments if needed. Start file names with a number value to aid auto-completion.

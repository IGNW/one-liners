### Simple script to login to vault with your ldap username and password while not persisting your token. Normally a token is stored in ~/.vault-token
### This circumvents that and persists only while the shell is live
### you can see your token by checking the environment variable
### `env | grep VAULT_TOKEN`
export VAULT_TOKEN="$(vault login -token-only -method=ldap username=tylerw)"
